.\INT. HOUSE - DAY
>.The camera shows different objects incluing a newspaper, a
>.hat and calendar showing '19th June' as well as other common
>.house props. The camera switches to a scene showing a yellow
>.puppet wearing childish clothes, a duck wearing clothes
>.commonly worn by senior citizens, and a red, humanoid
>.character wearing all red. The camera switches to the
..notepad on the table from a birdseye view.
._NOTEPAD
.((The notepad opens)
.:What's your favourite idea?
>.All the other puppets look at the notepad with a suprised
..face.
._NOTEPAD
.:Mine is being creative.
._Yellow guy
.:How do you get that idea?
._NOTEPAD
.:I just tried to think creatively.
>.The notepad uses it's pencil to point at an orange in the
..fruit bowl.
._NOTEPAD
>:Now when you look at this orange,
.:tell me please, what do you see?
._Duck
.:It's just a boring old orange.
._NOTEPAD
>:Maybe to you, but not to me. I see
.:a silly face!
._YELLOW GUY
.:Woah!
._NOTEPAD
.:Walking along and smiling at me. 
._DUCK
.:I don't see what you mean.
._NOTEPAD
.:Cause your not thinking creatively!
>.The notepad lifts itself up to reavel a multi-coloured mess,
..aka hair.
._NOTEPAD
.:So take a look at my hair!
._All except notepad
.:COOL!
._NOTEPAD
.:I used my hair to express myself.
._RED GUY
.:That sounds really boring.
._NOTEPAD
.:I used my hair to express myself.
>.The scene changes to the notepad sitting on the radio with
>.all the other puppets gathered around it and it uses it's
..pencil to point out of the window.
._NOTEPAD
>:Now, when you stare at the clouds
>:in the sky, don't you find it
.:exciting?
._ALL EXCEPT NOTEPAD
.:No.
._NOTEPAD
.:C'mon, take another look.
._YELLOW GUY
.:Oh wait!
._ALL EXCEPT NOTEPAD
>:I can see a hat, I can see a cat, I
>:can see a man with a baseball bat!
>:I can see a dog, I can a see a
>:frog, I can see a ladder leaning on
.:a log!
._NOTEPAD
>:Think you're getting the hang of it
>:now. Using your minds to have a
.:good time.
._YELLOW GUY
.:I might paint a picture of a clown.
._NOTEPAD
>((He uses the pencil to
>(drown and cover the
>(painting in black
.(paint.)
>:Woah there friend, you might need
.:to slow down!
..The notepad returns to the table.
._NOTEPAD
.:Here's another good tip.
._ALL EXCEPT NOTEPAD
.:Yeah?
._NOTEPAD
>:On how to be a creative wiz-kid. Go
>:and collect some leaves and sticks
>:and arrange them into your
.:favourite colour.
._RED GUY
.:Blue!
._DUCK
.:Red!
._YELLOW GUY
.:Green!
._NOTEPAD
>((Moving an 'x' over the
>(green leaves and sticks
.(arrangment.)
.:Green is not a creative colour.
._YELLOW GUY
.:Awwwwwww.
._NOTEPAD
>:There's one more thing that you
>:need to know before you let your
>:creativity flow. Listen to your
>:heart, listen to the rain, listen
>:to the voices in your brain! C'mon
.:guys, lets get creative!
>.Madness. Yellow Guy is making something, red guy is
>.sprinkling some glitter across a table, Duck puts a 'D' on
>.the table, some strange 3D camera effects, and all of the
>.puppets have turned into real sized models that are sitting
>.around the table. There is a heart on the table with red
>.guys hand in the corner, Yellow Guy is going crazy making
>.some things, Red Guy is sprinkling glitter over the heart
>.and the real-sized models are doing some crazy dancing. The
>.weather outside changes to thunder and lightning. More crazy
>.lightning. The red guy picks up the heart and turns it
>.around. Red guy is going crazy, Red guy is smearing the
>.heart in left over glitter and even more craziness including
>.a cake with body parts and meat inside. What duck was
>.spelling is revealed to be death, there is a scream and
..everything is back to what it was before.
._NOTEPAD
>:Now let's all agree, to never be
.:creative again.
>.The notepad folds in on itself, and the episode ends with
..credits.
