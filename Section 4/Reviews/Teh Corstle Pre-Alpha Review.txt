textures low quality
for intro text put a continue button not a timer.
Weirdest controls I have ever seen
Holding shift does nothing obvious
Features seem to be missing
The cursor image is not rendered where the cursor actually is.
Tutorial text is rendered incorrectly sometimes
Moving sideways is EXTREMELY sensetive.
The text in the corner is tiny

Plus:
You added a save system!
